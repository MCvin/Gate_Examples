This example shows how to define a tessellated volume allowing to simulate a complex geometry imported from a CAD system. To be used, such a volume has to be declared by triangular facet in a text file (Suzanne.txt).
This tessellated volume is irradiated with a point source of monoenergetic 100 keV gammas.
MHD images containing the deposited dose in the volume are generated.
